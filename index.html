          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <h5>My professional career and personal interests are spurred on by the quest to find 
           patterns and logical approaches to solving problems be it engineering related 
           or music composition. Applying structured problem solving to the many challenges I meet at work, 
           home or play shapes my view that life is about problem solving.</h5>
